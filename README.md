# CICD Recitation Demo

This small demo project is for a recitation on CI/CD using GitHub Actions. It includes:

- A tiny frontend (`index.html`, `src/app.js`) styled with Tailwind (via CDN) to keep things simple.
- A few unit tests written with Jest in `tests/app.test.js`.

Quickstart

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run tests locally:

```bash
npm test
```

3. Serve the demo site locally:

```bash
npm start
# then open http://localhost:3000
```
